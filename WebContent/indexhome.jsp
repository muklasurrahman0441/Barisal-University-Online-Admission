<p align="justify">
The declaration for establishing a Public University in the then Barisal division was made by the Founder of Bangladesh, 
the Father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1973. Several half-hearted attempts were made by the different 
political governments after 1980s but it was in 2009 that the establishment of the University got meaningfully underway by the Ministry of Education, 
and the Honorable President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Md. Zillur Rahman appointed Professor Dr. Md. Harunor Rashid Khan of the Department of Soil, 
Water and Environment of the University of Dhaka on 18th February 2010 as the Project Director to establish the University of Barisal. 

<span id="dots">...</span>

<span id="more">

The law of the University of Barisal has been amended and passed by the National Assembly of Bangladesh on 16th June 2010. 
Thanks to further initiatives from University Grants Commission and the Ministry of Education, 
the University was eventually established by the Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina through foundation stone laying on 22nd February 2011. 
Then the University of Barisal started functioning from the first day of July 2011 in a temporary campus at college buildings of Barisal Zilla School. 
Honorable President Md. Zillur Rahman and Professor Dr. Md. Harunor Rashid Khan adorned the chairs of the Founder Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor respectively. 
In the first academic year (2011-2012) there are four faculties; Arts, Science, Social Sciences, Business Studies that include six departments. 
In the first academic session (2011-2012), there will be four hundred students, twenty five teachers, fifteen officers and thirty five staffs. 
The University of Barisal is a public University and will run like a autonomous University as else in Bangladesh. 
The University administration will now be run mainly by two bodies: Syndicate and Academic Council, each headed by the Vice-Chancellor.
 As proposed, the university will be built in Karnakati, a place famous for it’s scenic beauty and an unmolested ecosystem. 
 With the kirtonkhola flowing just by on the southern side and soothing gales pervading the lush green pasture, 
 the place reminds one of why Barisal is known to all of us as the land of plenitude. Away from the crowd and commotion of the metropolitan life, 
 blessed with exquisite natural charms and meditative tranquility, 
 the place promises to be an ideal setting for learners to learn their lessons of self-control and pursue distinguished academic career simultaneously.
  As the road to Bhola passes close by, the location will enjoy greater communicational accessibility from different parts of the country,
   transforming the region in the process, from its rural backwater status to one of academic and intellectual excellence. 
   Inspired by the love of the people and boosted by the due patronage from the relevant authority, The university is destined to be the pride of the place.
    A total of 75 crore of taka has been sanctioned in order to build the eighth general public university of the country and the maiden one for the southern region. 
    A sprawling land of 50 acre has already been acquired to this effect. 
    The original plan contains construction of an unique ‘eight’ shaped academic building including residences for the vice-chancellor, 
    registrar, quarters for teachers, staffs, separate dormitories for male and female students, building for central library etc. 
    There is also provision for building prayer houses for different believers. 
    One eye-catching feature of the new campus will be its internal space-management. 
    Besides having state-of-the art facilities in place, the campus will have its open space punctuated by patterned greenery and a beautiful pond at the heart of it. 
    As the construction of the new campus is predicted to be completed by mid-2013, 
    the academic activities of the university will, however, be run on temporary basis in two college buildings of the Barisal Zilla School. 
    On 23rd August, amid much enthusiasm, the admission of students for the session of 2011-12 was inaugurated by the Hon’ble Minister of Education, 
    Nurul Islam Nahid MP with his rending SMS through state-owned Teletalk company. The ceremony was also attended by the Hon’ble Vice-Chancellor of the University
     Prof. Dr. Md. Harunor Rashid Khan, the secretary of the Ministry of the Education Dr. Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury, 
     Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dhaka, Prof. Dr. Harun-ur-Rashid, the members of the syndicate and other eminent personalities.
      The duration of the on-line registration will last from 23rd August to 22nd October. This year, a total of 400 students, selected through a standard admission test, 
      will study in six departments under three faculties. 
      The University of Barisal pursues an irreproachably honest and transparent policy in recruiting teachers with merit and scholarship being the sole yardstick.
       Already a number of teachers have been recruited and recruitment of others is in progress. 
       The syllabus of the departments concerned are not only modernized but so designed as to equip a learner with requisite knowledge and expertise to help him cope with complex global scenario. 
       Keeping this in perspective, modern trends in global scholarship will be introduced to the learners in a syllabus that will be approached in a semester system with required credit division. 
       The university is also trying to provide scholarships for students and teachers to make the university ‘a centre of excellence’. 
       The university will form different clubs to accelerate co-curricular activities of the students. The university is determined to help students explore there abilities in various field of knowledge. 
       The university has already formed different committees headed by the teachers to look after both curricular and co-curricular activities.

<span id="moree">

   
 The University of Barisal stands on the bank of the Kirtonkhola in the south central region of the country- a location hailed as the ‘Best Site’ for a University outside Dhaka by Govt. & Non-Govt. several visiting team including a high powered team of UGC in 2011. Blessed with exquisite bio-diversity, scenic coastal beauty and a rich cultural heritage of its own, the region is proud to have its first-ever general public university as the University of Barisal. It was first envisioned by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman immediately after the War of Liberation and finally materialized by the daughter of the Father of the Nation, Hon’ble Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Jononetri Sheikh Hasina on 22 February 2011 through laying the foundation stone. The establishment of the University brings into reality the dreams of millions who have been cherishing the desire for higher education at their footsteps since independence.

 
On 24 January 2012, the University of Barisal officially started its academic journey. In session 2011-12, 400 students out of 9998 candidates have been admitted in six departments (English, Economics, Mathematics, Sociology, Marketing, Management Studies) under four faculties (Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Social Sciences and Faculty of Business Studies). In session 2013-13 out of 17,990 examinee/candidates 700 students have been admitted. Six new departments will be opened under the faculties as follows- Faculty of Science and Engineering: Department of Chemistry and Department of Computer Science & Engineering; Faculty of Bio-sciences and Agriculture: Botany and crop Sciences; Faculty of Social Sciences: Political science; Faculty of Business Studies: Finance and Banking; and Faculty of Law: Department of Law. A total of 1050 students will be admitted in the said 16 departments for the session 2013-14. The submission of online application for the session 2013-14 will take place from 4th September to 14th October 2013 as the admission tests for all units are scheduled to commence on 27th and 28th November 2013.

 
At present the University is being served by a group of qualified faculties blessed with youthful vigor and global outlook and a section of officers who proudly possess enviable academic feats to their names and are deeply committed to produce world class graduates in the disciplines of science, bio-sciences and agriculture, social science, arts, business and law to meet national and global demands for enlightenment and quality education. As we expect nothing less than superlative performance from students, teachers and officers alike, we have decided to award them performance-enhancing incentives on different categories. Top three students in each semester will be awarded Taka 2000.00 per month. There are special awards for best teacher, officer and staff, and there are VCs and Dean’s Awards too reserved for the most outstanding students and teachers.

The University incorporates values unique to the experiences of a coastal population living in the vicissitudes of environmental changes and passionately strives to uphold them in setting goals. The focus is not only to produce a skilled and marketable workforce for the country but one that is innovative in ideas, resilient in spirit and deeply informed of the intrinsic socio-economic patterns and lifestyle of people of this region. In that way the University is determined to act as a catalyst in major economic, social and cultural changes of the region while transforming itself into a centre of academic excellence for promotion of human, economical and technological development in Bangladesh.

 
Having started our journey, we already know that the path ahead is a steep one and we must go a long way to attain our mission and vision of establishing a fully technology based university with professional orientation to the field of academic research. As we proudly represent a region which has a legendary cultural past and is home to some glorious sons of the land, we declare to spare no efforts in living up to that honored task. It is therefore highly imperative that everyone associated with the university must work together and work tirelessly for the dream of transforming this institution into a centre of learning, teaching, and research. It is our hope that this website will keep visitors abreast with updated information regarding various events and academic schedules of the University while it is expected to get richer with incorporation of further facts and details in course of time.
